# SAHYOG-a revolutionary healthcare ecosystem

The Problem: India, despite having robust identity systems like Aadhar and employment qualifications like PAN, lacks a comprehensive healthcare ecosystem. This absence leaves a significant void in the nation's overall well-being, impacting not just individual health but also the economic landscape. The lack of a streamlined healthcare model in India poses challenges in accessing timely medical advice, leading to delayed treatments, increased health risks, and subsequently, reduced workforce productivity.


## How SAHYOG Solves the Problem:

###  SAHYOG CARD:
Introducing the SAHYOG Card, a unique health identity that is decentralised(Thanks to Polygon) and easily identifiable. It creates a way to be recognised in a healthcare ecosystem.

* #### One-on-One Sessions:
